## Overview
Monte Carlo methods are a class of algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results. They are widely used in simulations, statistical inference, and optimization problems.

## Implemented Algorithms
The following Monte Carlo methods are implemented in this repository:

1. **Box-Muller Algorithm (`box_muller_algorithm.py`)**  
   - Generates normally distributed random numbers using the Box-Muller transform.

2. **Hastings-Metropolis Algorithm (`hastings_metropolis_algorithm.py`)**  
   - A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for obtaining a sequence of random samples from a probability distribution.

3. **Inverse Sampling Transform (`inverse_sampling_transform.py`)**  
   - A technique for generating random variables with a specified distribution using the inverse transform method.

4. **Reject Sampling Algorithm (`reject_sampling_algorithm.py`)**  
   - A method for generating samples from a probability distribution by rejecting certain candidates based on a criterion.

5. **Simulated Annealing (`simulated_annealing.py`)**  
   - A probabilistic optimization algorithm that mimics the annealing process in metallurgy to find a global minimum.

## Usage

Each script can be executed independently. Example usage:
```bash
python box_muller_algorithm.py 
```
